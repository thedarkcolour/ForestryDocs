# Forestry: CE Docs
This documentation is intended for _modpack makers_.   

To see how to add a new bee species using KubeJS, see [Bees with KubeJS](./kubejs/bees.md).


If you are a mod developer who wishes to integrate with Forestry's code, all
documentation is provided as Javadocs in the source code.
As of 12/31/2024, Forestry does not yet have an official Maven repository.
